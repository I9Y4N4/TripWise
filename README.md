### OnTheWay

#### Description of Basic Features:
The app will take input from the user (starting point, ending point, and a keyword describing the desired stop along the way) and return a list and map of specific businesses and their distance (in time) from the user's route. Users can then select from the list of business, which will display their complete directions, including the added waypoint, on the map and in text form. A "Send to Phone" button will send a link to the user's phone, allowing them to open the directions in Google Maps.
